# --- Content Rules ---
# Persistent DO's and DON'Ts the AI follows during generation.
# To use built-in defaults, omit this section entirely.
rules:
  do:
    - "Include specific data points or statistics when available"
    - "Reference the source or study when citing facts"
    - "Write with a clear, authentic voice — not generic marketing speak"
  dont:
    - "Never use clickbait or sensationalist language"
    - "Avoid generic hype phrases like 'revolutionize', 'game-changer', or 'disrupt'"
    - "Don't start posts with 'Exciting news!' or similar clichés"

# --- Style Examples ---
# Paste 2-3 posts you like. The AI uses these as reference for your voice and style.
